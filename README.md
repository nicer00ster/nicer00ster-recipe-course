# React Recipes

Building a web app to use as my first course I'll be releasing within the next couple months on YouTube. Will be free. ðŸ™‹

## Getting Started

This course is recommended for people who already have a basic understanding of JavaScript. I'll be going over all the code, so you could potentially watch the course without knowing how to code, but it is recommended so you'll benefit most from it.

I will be creating a new repo with starter files and stepped solutions.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS
```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```
React Developer Tools (If you're following the course)
```

```
React & PostCSS
```
npm install -g postcss autoprefixer create-react-app

```

### Installing
